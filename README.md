# Cotton Plant Disease Detection and Get Cure AI APP

The major problem that the farmers around the world face is losses, because of pests, disease or a nutrient deficiency. They depend upon the information that they get from the agricultural departments for the diagnosis of plant leaf disease. This process is lengthy and complicated. Here comes a system to help farmers everywhere in the world by automatically detecting cotton leaf diseases accurately and within no time. In this paper, the proposed system uses a type of CNN for classification of leaf disease. Several experiments are performed on the dataset to get the accurate output. The proposed system can effectively identified different types of diseases with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plantâ€™s area.

In this we are focuses on detecting cotton leaf diseases at an early stage, thereby decreasing the chances of the destruction of the whole plant. Traditional methods of detecting a disease include manual examining of a leaf and predicting the disease. But a farmer cannot determine the exact disease by this technique. Therefore, knowing the accurate disease image processing techniques can be utilized to recognize the disease of the plant leaf. These are modern techniques that make use of new technologies that give accurate results. 

## Data Pre-Processing
It Contains several steps like :

<li>Data Collection
<li>Data Import
<li>Data Inspection
<li>Data Splitting
<li>Resizing image data
  
## Feature Extraction
In Traditional Machine Learning
<ol>
Input Image >> Feature Selections >> Classifier >> Result

In Deep Learning
Input Image >> Neural Network >> Result

For CNN
Input Layer >> Hidden Layers >> Output

Here, input layer takes the input and output gives the desired output. That means hidden layer is doing some feature extractions. And if we extract the outputs of the hidden layers, then we will get different features.

So basically, In ML we have to create our own feature vector, while for DL algorithms they extract features automatically in convolution layers
